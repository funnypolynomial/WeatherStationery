WeatherStationery displays the current conditions and a “forecast” on a small 200x200 ePaper display.
The current pressure, temperature and humidity are shown along with an icon and a text description of the forecast ("Rain at times, worse later." etc), as deduced by the Zambretti Forecaster.

I crafted a simple stroked font for the text.

A PCB acts as the front face of the enclosure and circuitry for a small Arduino and sensor.

The Gerber files for the PCB are in the resources folder, along with the [Inksnek](https://github.com/funnypolynomial/inksnek) code to create the laser-cut enclosure.
